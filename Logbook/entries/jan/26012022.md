I started by cloning the RTC Multiconnect repo and testing it in my broswer. I then looked at chrome://webrtc-internals to see information about the data. After a meeting with my supervisor, Dr. Miroslaw Narbutt, I found out that the main aim of the project is to create a responsive GUI on top of the WebRTC multi-connection library, rather than using the WebRTC API from scratch. He also gave me a copy of "Getting Started with WebRTC" by Rob Mason, and recommended that I take a look at https://bloggeek.me and https://webrtchacks.com
