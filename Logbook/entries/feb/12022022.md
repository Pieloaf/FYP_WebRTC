I decided to move to using the grid css property although I still was unhappy with the repsonsiveness of the video tiling. I also made the chat fill the whole screen on mobile. Grid seems like a good way to approach this as it as a tilling scalable grid using the auto-fill and repeat properties however it is less flexible than flex box and so may cause issues later. While researching I found [this](https://github.com/Alicunde/Videoconference-Dish-CSS-JS) small library called dash which was built with flexbox.
