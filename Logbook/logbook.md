## Introduction

This log book is going to document my research and work done in creating a video conferencing system using the WebRTC API and a JS framework for the front-end.
This will be achieved by using [this](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection) repo as a base for the project and bulding a GUI upon it. STUN and TURN servers will then be added to support the WebRTC connection behind NATs and firewalls.
